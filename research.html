    <strong>Abstract:</strong>

    This paper estimates the long-run impact of childhood exposure to public
    health initiatives on adult human capital. From 1908 to 1933, local
    governments in the United States instituted county-level health departments
    (CHDs) that provided sanitation and health services geared toward children.
    To estimate the long-term benefits, I exploit variation in the timing,
    location, and age of CHD exposure. Children treated under the age of five
    show later-life earnings improvements of two to five percent. Further, CHD
    boys not only perform better than later- and never-treated groups but, after
    adding household fixed effects, these children earn more than their brothers
    and their fathers. Finally, I investigate the mechanisms underlying this
    effect and demonstrate that higher earnings emerge from better adult health,
    measured by body mass index and the probability of living to age 80.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong>

    This study assesses the mortality decline associated with one of the first
    and most extensive rural public health efforts in the United States. Between
    1908 and 1933, county governments enacted county health departments (CHDs)
    that provided sanitation and child-oriented health services. Using an event
    study design, I exploit variation in the location and timing of CHD arrival
    to measure the health effects. I find that CHD entry led to a decline in
    infant mortality, but provided little advantage to overall population
    health. For infants, CHDs prevented two deaths per 1,000 births, which
    accounts for 8-10% of the period-specific mortality decline. The effect is
    most substantial in rural-only counties where infant mortality declines by
    roughly three deaths per 1,000 births.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper examines the factors that shaped the
    appropriation of rural public health through county health departments
    (CHDs) in the early twentieth century. Using digitized county-level records
    on property values and taxation, I find that adopting states had local
    governments centered around the county. Within state, I discover that
    counties implementing  services were more urban and had higher per household
    property values and taxes. Based on these findings, I consider whether the
    CHDs were redistributive within county and find that CHDs operated in areas
    with higher levels of land and income inequality. These results suggest that
    public programs based on local revenue may help to mitigate inequality
    within the region of jurisdiction but may exacerbate disparities between
    adopting and non-adopting areas. External funding from higher levels of
    government as well as private donors helped to randomize the effort and
    spread the health services more evenly between counties.
