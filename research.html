  <p class="abstract">
    <strong>Abstract:</strong> This study assesses the impact of an American
    rural public health intervention on child mortality over the years 1908 to
    1933. Due to the absence of sanitation and child-oriented health services
    outside of urban areas, public and private agencies sponsored county-level
    health departments (CHDs) throughout the United States. Population health
    improvements are identified through variation in the location and timing of
    investments. Results reveal mortality declines for infants and young
    children under the age of five. For the general population, CHDs prevent
    roughly three child deaths per 1,000 births. Nonwhite infants are
    disproportionately benefited and experience a reduction by seven deaths per
    1,000 births.

  <h4>Human Capital Formation and the Childhood Disease Environment: Evidence
    from Rural Public Health Improvements</h4>

  <p class="abstract">
    <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper investigates the persistent effect of
    an improved childhood disease environment on adult human capital. Over the
    years 1908 to 1933 public and private agencies in the United States
    instituted county-level health departments (CHDs) that provided sanitation
    and health services geared toward children. I exploit variation in exposure
    to CHDs to map the benefits into adulthood. Children treated under age five
    show later-life earnings improvements by 3-4 percent. I investigate the
    channels for this effect, focusing on health and schooling, and demonstrate
    that human capital improvements result from better adult health, measured by
    cognition and body mass index.

  <h4>The Political Economy of Local Public Health: Progressive Era Influence in
    Rural Areas</h4>

  <p class="abstract">
    <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper examines the factors that shaped the
    appropriation of rural public health through county health departments
    (CHDs) in the early twentieth century. Using two measures of Progressive
    influence, third party votes and attendance at a social gospel church, the
    analysis tests whether CHD adoption is related to the Progressive Era
    agendas. Results find that participating states are more Progressive, while
    individual counties are less aligned with Progressive thought. Instead,
    local county governments appear to allocate funds according to their ability
    instead of their need. Area-specific health conditions do not predict county
    CHD activity. Instead, local support is predicted by the area's propensity
    to provide other public goods, as well as the taxable values of income and
    land.  This distribution of CHDs in wealthy areas is partially counteracted
    through grants from outside public and private agencies. The donation
    patterns of external sources appear unrelated to area-specific social,
    political, and demographic factors."
