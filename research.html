<h4>Explaining Declines in US Rural Mortality, 1910-1933: The Role of County Health Departments</h4>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
This study estimates the impact of an American rural public health
program on child mortality over 1908 to 1933. Due to the absence of
sanitation and child-oriented health services outside of urban
areas, public and private agencies sponsored county-level health
departments (CHDs) throughout the US. Variation in the location and
timing of the CHDs identifies improvements in population health,
which are captured entirely by children. Mortality declines emerge
in infancy and gradually decay through childhood. Adversely affected
areas with either an ample population of nonwhites or greater levels
of preexisting infectious disease undergo larger reductions in
mortality.</p>
