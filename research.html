    <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper estimates the long-run impact of
    childhood exposure to public health initiatives on adult human capital.
    From 1908 to 1933, local governments in the United States instituted
    county-level health departments (CHDs) that provided sanitation and health
    services geared toward children. To estimate the long-term benefits, I
    exploit variation in the timing, location, and age of CHD exposure. Children
    treated under the age of five show later-life earnings improvements of three
    to four percent. I investigate the mechanisms underlying this effect and
    demonstrate that higher earnings emerge from better adult health, measured
    by cognition, body mass index, and the probability of living to age 80.

    <strong>Abstract:</strong> This study assesses the impact of an American
    rural public health intervention on child mortality over the years 1908 to
    1933. Due to the absence of sanitation and child-oriented health services
    outside of urban areas, public and private agencies sponsored county-level
    health departments (CHDs) throughout the United States. Population health
    improvements are identified through variation in the location and timing of
    investments. Results reveal mortality declines for infants and young
    children under the age of five. For the general population, CHDs prevent
    roughly three child deaths per 1,000 births. Nonwhite infants are
    disproportionately benefited and experience a reduction by seven deaths per
    1,000 births.

  <h4 class="research-title">The Political Economy of Local Public Health</h4>

  <p class="abstract">
    <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper examines the factors that shaped the
    appropriation of rural public health through county health departments
    (CHDs) in the early twentieth century. Using digitized county-level
    records on property values and taxation, I find that adopting areas had more
    influential county governments and higher per household property values and
    taxes. This finding suggests that CHDs are instituted according to the
    ability of the county government to fund public programs and may exacerbate
    between-county inequality. For the areas that did adopt the program,
    however, CHDs are redistributive in nature, as they operated in areas with
    higher levels of land and income inequality. These results suggest that
    public programs based on local revenue may help to mitigate inequality
    within the area of jurisdiction but may exacerbate disparities between
    adopting and non-adopting areas. External funding from higher levels of
    government, as well as private donors, helps alleviate the between county
    inequality.
