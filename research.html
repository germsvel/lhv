<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
This study assesses the impact of an American rural public health intervention
on child mortality over the years 1908 to 1933. Due to the absence of sanitation
and child-oriented health services outside of urban areas, public and private
agencies sponsored county-level health departments (CHDs) throughout the United
States. Population health improvements are identified through variation in the
location and timing of investments. Results reveal mortality declines for
infants and young children under the age of five. For the general population,
CHDs prevent roughly three child deaths per 1,000 births. Nonwhite infants are
disproportionately benefited and experience a reduction by seven deaths per
1,000 births.</p>
